            <p class="slate-80 text-6xl flex-left" style="max-width: 1000px; text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1rem;">About Me</p>
            <p class="slate-80" style="max-width: 1000px;">I'm a User Experience Researcher / Designer who works to make technology more accessible and easier to use for the widest range of users, and to use technology to connect people with other people, information and services that bolster life satisfaction. I'm a master's degree student at the University of Michigan's School of Information, where I study Social Computing, Human Computer Interaction and User Experience Research and Design. With an undergraduate background in psychology and entrepreneurship, user-centered product design connects my curiosity about human behavior, my interest in improving well-being, and my passion for innovating new technologies and products.</p>

                <li>
                    <p class="slate-80" style="max-width: 1000px;">Demonstrating my passion for Interaction Design, through my schoolwork, projects, and internship experiences, I have applied Design Concepts that reflect my empathy for the user; to identify, articulate and build the users' needs into my work I have relied on qualitative and quantitative UX Research - including the creation of personas and storyboards, conducting stakeholder interviewing, and the building of affinity walls, as well as on usability testing. Whether it's helping students to access mental health services more easily and to find best-for-them study spaces or helping elderly library patrons explore and access public library services, I'm designing for the user. My high-fidelity prototype design work, in university, public library, and city government sectors, has been incorporated into existing websites, enhancing the user experience.</p>
                    <p class="slate-80" style="max-width: 1000px;">I enjoy working with agile teams, collaborating with other designers and interdisciplinary team members to design the best solutions, and ones that are pleasurable to use and reflect the latest design techniques. The collaborations are reflected in dynamic, empathic wireframes, and prototypes, that tell a compelling story about the work, to be shared with all interested stakeholders. Experienced in agile project management techniques, I have successfully managed teams to meet tight deadlines and to produce accessible and stylish design solutions.</p>
