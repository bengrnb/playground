                        <p>The client. a public library in a smaller semi-rural community in Michigan, which serves as the information and cultural hub of its geographic area, sought a user needs evaluation and a user experience design consultation to be able to provide the best web-based experience for the community. The current site struggled with accessibility, technical problems loading on some devices, jargony language which often frustrated patrons, and a confusing, overstimulating layout which stymied patrons in their search for information. Given the central role this public library plays in connecting citizens to information and to each other via community events and activities, it was hoped that a major-overhaul of the website would better serve all sectors of the community, from children/teens to young adults, to the elderly.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>The client partnered with the University of Michigan's School of Information (UMSI) Design Clinic, a competitive (via application) UX design experience, which provides small interdisciplinary teams of students the opportunity to work with clients "to seek innovative solutions to information challenges." I worked as a Needs and Usability Researcher, and UX Researcher and Designer on the project.</p>

                            Our team redesigned the information architecture and most-used pages of the website to make it less overwhelming, confusing, and unwieldy to navigate, enhancing its ability to connect patrons to information, events and resources outside of the library walls.

                            Our team analyzed the Cromaine Library Google analytics to get a high level understanding of who is using the Cromaine webiste and how it is being used. The analysis inluded which type of devices were being used to access the website, user age demographics and pageviews. Here are some key takeaways:

                                <p>While the majority (62.4%) of library patrons accessed the website using a desktop device, more than a third (35.7%) relied on their mobile device, with the remaining patrons using a tablet (1.9%), highlighting the need to redesign the website with attention to both desktop and mobile applications.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>The library website was found to be visited by a wide age-range of patrons, from age 18 to 65+, in equal measure, with the exception of patrons ages 35-44 years, who were the most frequent users. The website's design must, then, be accessible and useable by this full developmental range.</p>

                                <p>Over half of the visits to the website were to the homepage (53%), with much of the remaining visits focused on the summer reading program (15%) and the events/calendar (9%) pages. Because they are the most visited pages, we focused our redesign efforts on the Homepage and Events/Calendar pages. It became clear in our interview and survey user data, however, that the infrequency of visits to certain pages (e.g., those connecting patrons to desired digital resources and services) reflected design barriers to those pages, not lack of user interest. Survey/interview data (described below) highlighted the need to further focus redesign efforts on Digital Resources pages (e.g., connecting patrons to external sites and resources they can access with their Cromaine library card).</p>

                        <p>Instead of requiring the user to view all of the links from one visually overwhelming dropdown menu, in the redesign, we made the navigation bar simler and more discoverable. We did so by removing redundant links, rewording navigaiton items to make them more user-friendly, refreshing the visual design of the header and footer and putting links where users were more likely to expect them.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>We made it easier to use the site's search feature, which was one of the most used but most difficult to find features on the website, by positioning the search to the right side of the nav bar and having it dropdown below the nav bar when it was active.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Having analyzed what information users were actually using on the Homepage, we redesigned it so that only the most used resources and information were presented on the page, enhancing easy access to desired information. We simplified the layout of the Homepage, so that it could be easily updated and changed as the library's resources change over time. We demonstrated how the redesign would translate from Desktop to Mobile devices.</p>

                        <p>On the original website, the library's digital resources (i.e., external websites that could be accessed through a Cromaine Library membership) could only be accessed through the unwieldy, visually overwhelming dropdown menu; there was no landing page for all of the digital resources. Prior to the redesign, each digital resource was only represented by its link name, lacking any description of what the resource offers. We added descriptions of the resources and also grouped them into categories, significantly enhancing the ease and efficacy of user search efforts.</p>

                        <p>One staff member captured something in her statement of appreciation, that we hoped we had infused our redesign with: "Thank you ALL for your professionalism, talent, and joy. We're so grateful for absolutely everything!" It was, indeed, a UX designer's joy to design an interface that would help people of all ages better and more enjoyably access information and events from within the heart of their own community, their own public library.</p>
