                        <p>Ann Arbor parking is currently much more expensive and difficult to find than it should be. Especially in croweded areas and during popular events such as football games, residents can spend a lot of time driving around looking for parking spaces; sometimes not being able to access emenities they knew would be available. Some examples of other parking services exist, however their service and care is not as reliable and optimal for customers. When residents do find parking, the cost of a space is high and there are no affordable alternatives. Parking should be consistent and accommodate everyone. There needs to be a fair and equitable change in finding parking options that are affordable and realistic to get a hold of.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Our primary goal was to improve the parking situation of Ann Arbor by addressing its problems. We were interested in creating a mutually beneficial exchange between residential parking space owners and potential renters to alleviate some of the challenges with parking in Ann Arbor.</p>

                            I found that there are a lot of study spaces on campus, but no central service to sort through and view all of the spaces, which makes it difficult for students to discover new spaces. Additionally, there is very little informaiton provided about study spaces, and students have specific preferences for what constitutes a "good" space for them.

                            Students want to be able to find spaces quickly and many preferred to find spaces that were close by, so that they could access them between classes and travel to them on foot. The needs students had for study spaces differed as well, depending on personal preferences and the tasks they needed to complete (e.g. background noise vs silent, group work vs individual work).

                            The tools all offered a way to locate spaces (some with very limited options), with some ability to reserve spaces, but their reservation functions were confucing to use and often produced misleading results. Some tools included very limited descriptions of amenities in the rooms (e.g., printers) and a few offered the option to filter spaces based on limited amenity offerings. None of the tools offered students the option to upload their own pictures of spaces, to review the spaces or suggest spaces. Finally, none of the competitors had all of the elements student users reported that they needed/wanted.

                        <p>The tool will have a positive social impact on the U of M campus in 3 ways:</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <ul class="bullet-list">
                            <li>
                                <p>It will promote social engagement with the campus community by encouraging students to contribute to the growth of the site to help one another have a better experience finding best-for-them study spaces.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>As the tool reduces frustration and stress for already stressed students when they are looking for spaces, and helps people do their best academically by helping them identify optimal study spaces, the tool will promote mental health and academic success.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>The tool will promote equity and support students' diverse needs; the tool makes it easy for all students to access the same information, quickly and easily. In addition, I hope that having access to rich information will be of special help to students with disabilities who may need extra help identifying spaces that are a good fit for their needs.</p>
