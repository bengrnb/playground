                        <p>CAPS nurtures the psychological development and emotional well-being of students through counseling, therapy, preventative and educational programming, outreach and consultation. The CAPS website redesign was initiated at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the challenge to transition what are traditionally face-to-face services to an online format was met with a marked increase in need for psychological support services; students faced academic disruption, social isolation, dislocation, loss, and fear about health and the future.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>For our ITS Summer 2020 Internship cohort project (all virtual), our 5 person team independently conceived of, pitched, and executed a redesign of the CAPS website with the goal of making it easier, quicker and less stressful for our already highly distressed peers to identify what services CAPS could offer and to navigate access to those resources. We realized we all had experience with peers sharing frustration about securing mental health services when needed. In addition, we noticed a number of issues and points of confusion with the existing CAPS website. CAPS encouraged and supported our efforts. Our team was the only Intern cohort to tackle a project outside of ITS.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>To improve the potential of the website to serve the needs and enhance the emotional well being of students, we recreated the website from the ground up (e.g., consolidating redundant information, assessing which pages were visited most and then making it easier to get to those pages, and making sure students could access emergency services no matter which page they were on). We focused on feedback which was deemed the most important by user research conducted with students, and by members of the CAPS staff whom we interviewed. My primary roles in the project included being the Project Manager (using Agile development practices) and UX Researcher/Designer.</p>
