                        <p class="problem-statement">Permanent Pixels is a Web3 NFT project. The aim of this project is to use technology to create art in a new and novel way, while also tackling some of the challenges that exist with NFT projects and the crypto space in general. I and one other team member have been working for more than a year to make what started as a crazy novel idea into a reality.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>The Permanent Pixels project was inspired by the infinite monkey theorem which states: "If a monkey hits keys on a typewriter an infinite number of times it could hypothetically type out the United States Declaration of Independence, Romeo and Juliet, or any text with significant meaning. Infinite possibilities means that all possible combinations are possible."</p></li>
                    <li><p>Our project operates under a similar theory we have named the Infinite Ape Theory: “Randomly changing the color of pixels in an image, an infinite number of times, will eventually result in visually significant creations.”</p></li>
                    <li><p>In other words, we are randomly generating images that will mostly look like QR codes, but have the potential to resemble real images and using technology to do so in ways that have not been done before.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Permanent Pixels are 50 “pixel” X 50 “pixel” images that are generated and stored 100% on chain on the Polygon network, in a truly random manner (using Chainlink VRF). Each image contains 2500 “pixels,” all of which have an equally likely chance to be black or white. There can be up to 10,000,000 (10 Million) Permanent Pixels created.</p></li>
                    <li><h3 class="mb-0 mt-2">Image</h3></li>
                    <li><p class="mt-0">Permanent Pixels are 50 X 50 grids of black and white squares; aka “pixels.” Each of the 2500 squares in the grid have an equally likely chance (50/50) of being either black or white. Below is a 50 X 50 grid of black and white pixels:</p></li>
                    <li style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img style="max-height: 300px; width: fit-content;" src="./images/pxlsnft/example_pixel_grid.png" alt="Example Pixel Grid"></li>
                    <li><h3 class="mb-0 mt-2">Creation</h3></li>
                    <li><p class="mt-0">Permanent Pixels will be created and held on the Polygon network and are generated completely on-chain and in a verifiably random manner.</p></li>
                    <li><h3 class="mb-0 mt-2">The difference between off-chain and on-chain NFT's</h3></li>
                    <li><p class="mt-0">Off-chain NFT's refer to NFT's that have some or all of their data stored outside of the blockchain. It is common practice to create all of the images and metadata for an NFT collection before it has actually launched, and then store that data in an off chain location, such as IPFS. When an NFT is minted, it will reference the off chain data but not actually create anything new. Two advantages of off chain NFT's are that they can be easier to create, and there are lower network fees required to mint them. One of the main disadvantages of off-chain NFT's is that their data is not permanently stored to the blockchain and could be deleted or edited in the future.</p></li>
                    <li><p>On-chain NFT's, on the other hand, have all of their data stored on the blockchain. On-chain NFT's can be difficult and expensive to create; Solidity (the coding language for smart contracts) and blockchains are not designed to create and store large amounts of image data. The advantage of having NFT data stored on the blockchain is that it cannot be edited or deleted like off-chain NFT's can; on-chain NFT's are permanent.</p></li>
                    <li><h3 class="mb-0 mt-2">What verifiably random means, and why it is important</h3></li>
                    <li><p class="mt-0">One challenge Solidity and the blockchain faces is the creation of truly random numbers. Pseudo random numbers can be created, but with the right motivation, someone can figure out how the pseudo randomness works and easily determine which pseudo random numbers will be generated. If not for the use of truly random numbers, there are a few reasons this could cause problems for Permanent Pixels. The first reason this is a concern, is because the Permanent Pixels are all generated on-chain. If the Permanent Pixels were generated off-chain, there would be no need to worry about using blockchain resources to create random numbers as all of the work to create randomness would be done off-chain. The second reason is that randomness will be used to determine how rare a Permanent Pixel is: the random number generated as the seed for each NFT will be used to determine how rare it is. There will be an in depth discussion about how the Permanent Pixel rarity works later on in the article, but for now, the important thing to know is that the more rare an NFT is, the more valuable it is. If Permanent Pixels used pseudo random numbers when generating NFT's on the blockchain, someone could potentially figure out how the randomness works and then mint all of the most valuable NFTs would give the most technical savvy an unfair advantage over others.</p></li>
                    <li><p>In comes Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function). Here is the description of Chainlink VRF from their website:</p></li>
                    <li><p class="quote-list">“Chainlink VRF enables smart contracts to access randomness without compromising on security or usability. With every new request for randomness, Chainlink VRF generates a random number and cryptographic proof of how that number was determined. The proof is published and verified on-chain before it can be used by any consuming applications. This process ensures that the results cannot be tampered with nor manipulated by anyone, including oracle operators, miners, users and even smart contract developers.”</p></li>
                    <li><p>Chainlink VRF eliminates the two problems described above by allowing for truly random and verified number generation on-chain. Each time a Permanent Pixel needs to be minted, a new random number is generated using Chainlink VRF that determines what it will look like.</p></li>
                    <li><h3 class="mb-0 mt-2">How Permanent Pixels use random numbers to determine color expression, and reduce cost</h3></li>
                    <li><p class="mt-0">As described in the previous section, a single random number is generated as the seed to create a Permanent Pixel. You may be wondering: how does a single random number determine how the 2500 different squares in a Permanent Pixel appear?</p></li>
                    <li><p>The initial number generated from the Chainlink VRF is a 32-byte random number.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Each bit in the base-2 representation of the 32-byte (256-bit) number represents a pixel in our Permanent Pixel, beginning from the top left, and continuing to the right.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Let's use the number 19…. as an example:</p></li>
                    <li><p>The binary representation of 19 in big-endian form is:</p></li>
                    <li><p style="background-color: white; color: black; width: fit-content;">10011</p></li>
                    <li><p>Each bit is consumed from smallest to largest (right to left) until all 256 bits have been used.</p></li>
                    <li><p>In a Permanent Pixel, the first 5 columns of the first row would appear as follows (0 represents Black, 1 represents White):</p></li>
                    <li><p style="background-color: white; color: black; width: fit-content;">White, White, Black, Black, White</p></li>
                    <li><p>If you are still reading this section of the article and have experience coding Solidity, you may have noticed a problem with this solution. It is only possible to request a number that is up to 256 bits long (uint256). There are 2500 'pixels' that need numbers to determine their color expression but only 256 to go around.</p></li>
                    <li><p>There are two possible ways to continue at their point, request more random numbers, or find a way to make the number longer. Requesting more random numbers would solve the problem, however ten different random numbers would need to be requested, and there is a fee associated with requesting random numbers, and so this method would make a Permanent Pixel 10x more expensive to produce.</p></li>
                    <li><p>We chose to use the second solution; make the number longer. Each time a random number is fully converted into a pixel representation (256 pixels), the number is hashed to a new 32-byte integer and used for further pixels.</p></li>
                    <li><h3 class="mb-0 mt-2">How is Permanent Pixel rarity and metadata set up?</h3></li>
                    <li><p class="mt-0">Permanent Pixels have two different rarity measures that are important to pay attention to. Visual Resemblance, which refers to how much the Permanent Pixel looks like something, and Mathematical Rarity, which refers to how mathematically likely it was for a Permanent Pixel to be randomly generated. Mathematical Rarity is included in the metadata but Visual Resemblance is not, as this measure is too subjective to quantify. In addition to Mathematical Rarity, the metadata will also include the name of the NFT (pulled from what number in the collection it is), the on-chain image data, and its skew, which describes if there are more black than white squares in the image, or an equal amount.</p></li>
                    <li><h3 class="mb-0 mt-2">Rarity:</h3></li>
                    <li><h3 class="mb-0">Mathematical Rarity</h3></li>
                    <li><p class="mt-0">Mathematical Rarity refers to how far a minted NFT deviates from its expected configuration. For each of the 2500 squares in a Permanent pixel, there is an equally likely chance that they will be either black or white. Since we know that the black and white odds are equal, we can assume that the “typical” Permanent Pixel will have 1250 white and 1250 black squares. The mathematical rarity is calculated by taking the absolute value of the difference between the total number of black and white squares (|black — white|). The lowest score a Permanent Pixel can have is 0, and the highest score is 2500. Keep in mind that the difficulty of getting a high score does not increase on a linear scale but an exponential one, so even relatively low Mathematical Rarity scores can represent extreme rarity.</p></li>
                    <li style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img style="max-height: 300px; width: fit-content;"src="./images/pxlsnft/example_permanent_pixel.png" alt="Example Permanent Pixel"></li>
                    <li><h3 class="mb-0 mt-2">Visual Resemblance</h3></li>
                    <li><p class="mt-0">Visual Resemblance refers to how recognizable an image is and the visual significance an image has. This can refer to pattern and object/picture representations. It is expected that the majority of the Permanent Pixels will not have Visual Resemblance. The Permanent Pixels that have Visual Resemblance will be extremely rare regardless of their Mathematical Rarity score.</p></li>
                    <li style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img style="max-height: 300px; width: fit-content;"src="./images/pxlsnft/example_balanced_pixel.png" alt="Example Perfectly Balanced Permanent Pixel"></li>
                    <li><p>Here in an example of a hypothetical Permanent Pixel with Visual Resemblance but a low rarity score. The image has 1250 black squares on the left side of the image and 1250 white squares on the right side of the image. The Mathematical Rarity score for this image would be 0, but the odds of generating such an image are catastrophically low, making it extremely rare. One good test of Visual Resemblance is if the appearance of the Permanent Pixel can easily be described.</p></li>
                    <li><h3 class="mb-0 mt-2">Easter Egg</h3></li>
                    <li><p class="mt-0">As discussed earlier in the randomness section of the article, there has been a significant effort made to ensure that each Permanent Pixel minted is completely random. As is the case with randomness, it is possible to generate the same number twice. While the odds are extremely unlikely, it is hypothetically possible to mint identical NFTs. The Permanent Pixels code does not check for or screen out duplicate NFT's to maintain pure randomness. If duplicate Permanent Pixels are created and discovered it would be extremely rare.</p></li>
                    <li><h3 class="mb-0 mt-2">Metadata:</h3></li>
                    <li><p class="mt-0">The metadata for Permanent Pixels will have 3 elements. Name, Mathematical Rarity and Skew. The name will be a number tied to the token ID for each Permanent Pixel, increasing linearly as more NFTs are minted. The Mathematical Rarity score will be expressed as an attribute, and as discussed earlier, will be used as the primary method to determine how rare a Permanent Pixel is. The skew value has no impact on an NFT's rarity, the skew is purely informational to let the owner know if their Permanent Pixel has more black or white pixels or an equal amount (equal amount would be a Mathematical Rarity score of 0). The image metadata will be a Base64 encoding of a SVG.</p></li>
                    <li><h3 class="mb-0 mt-2">How many Permanent Pixels will be available to mint, and how much will they cost to mint?:</h3></li>
                    <li><p class="mt-0">There is a max supply of 10 million Permanent Pixels. Each Permanent Pixel will cost .33 Matic to mint (excluding network fees). There is no limit to the number of Permanent Pixels that can be minted by one person, but a max of 1000 can be minted by an individual at a single time. The Permanent Pixels team does not take any royalties on secondary sales of Permanent Pixels (please be aware that NFT marketplaces can still take a percentage of sales revenue).</p></li>
                    <li><h3 class="mb-0 mt-2">Supply:</h3></li>
                    <li><h3 class="mb-0">Perspective</h3></li>
                    <li><p class="mt-0">There is a max supply of 10 million Permanent Pixels. Initially, this may seem like an extremely large supply: many large NFT projects have a max supply of 10 thousand NFT's, so why was the decision made to make the supply 1000x larger than the norm? To understand why the decision to make the max supply 10 million NFT's was made, we need to first add perspective. There are 2500 squares in each Permanent Pixel, each of which has 2 different possible combinations. This means that there are 2²⁵⁰⁰ possible combinations for Permanent Pixels. This number is so cosmically large, it is hard to understand.</p></li>
                    <li><p>To attempt to put this in perspective, it is estimated that there are 200 billion trillion stars in the universe. Here is that number:</p></li>

                    <li><p class="mt-0">By nature, the permanent pixles images are intended to be "low resolution." Each image only contains 2500 pixels, wheras the average 4k screen, contains more than 8 million pixels. Additionally, the images only use two colors: black and white; which is also very simple.</p></li>
                    <li><p>In contrast to having a simple image, the technology used in the project is pretty complicated. The "simple" images are being created in a uniqe way on the Polygon blockchain, which requires a lot of Web3 technology to pull off, and is actually pretty complicated.</p></li>
                    <li><p>To match the simple image and highly technical project, a few major design decisions were made:<li>
                    <li>
                        <ul class="bullet-list">
                            <li><p>Primarily pure black (#000000) and white (#FFFFFF) colors were used to match the NFT image colors</p></li>
                            <li><p>A monospace typeface, Space Mono, was chosen to match the monospace text used in computer terminals to match the technical aspect of the project</p></li>
                            <li><p>Designs were made to look almost "raw" and have a low fidelity, to match the resolution of the image.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><h3 class="mb-0 mt-2">Iteration 1: <s>The Good</s>, The Bad and The Ugly</h3></li>
                    <li><p>After putting the design ideology to work, we quickly realized that we had taken the idea of raw and low-fidelity wayyy too seriously as we stared at our creations in horror! It was immediately apparent that the brand would need more depth to make the project legitimate and enjoyable (and not look like it was created up in the 20th century).</p></li>

                    <li>
                        <p>The horrible design created in iteration 1 was admittedly created very quickly and as a means to turn what started as just an idea, into something tangible.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>At this stage of the project, the design was not the primary focus. Not because it wasn't considered important, but because my partner and I were still trying to figure out if the project was even possible. We were reading and writing articles, running code, reading documentation, watching youtube videos, and doing countless amount of research and work to learn about the blockchain and see if we could turn our idea into a reality.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>To alleviate the workload involved with making a website, we decided to use Squarespace. At the time, we were also sticking with most of the branding decisions from the first iteration :/. However, there was a catch. In order to interact with the blockchain and let pepole mint (aka, create or purchase) our NFTs, we needed to run a lot of custom code, which was not possible on Squarespace. The solution: create a primary website on Squarespace and have a custom minting page, that we made ourselves. Below is the Squarespace homepage and external mint page.</p></li>

                    <li><p>After months of development, we were able to say with confidence, that the project would become a reality. Our efforts had shifted from learning, to building. Branding and Design could become a priority.</p></li>
                    <li><h3>Iteration 3: Logo</h3></li>
                    <li><p>The Permanent Pixles Logo was created to resemble squares stacked on top of one another with the squares changing from white to black or black to white in equidistant increments. The changing colors of the squares are meant to represent the possibilties of Permanent Pixel images. Just as there are essentially infinite shades between white and black that are essentially infinite image combinations.</p></li>

                    <li><p>To create a seamless experience and consistent brand, we decided to not use a content management system to create the Permanent Pixels website, but instead hand code the site,with the assistance of some Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS styles and components to aid the design and development. In this iteration we focused on creating the basics and getting all of the essential information and features on the site.</p></li>

                    <li><p>A common theme with Web3 projects and Web3 in general is that there is a very high barrier to entry. Often, users will need to do a lot of due dilligence on their own to not only figure out how to interact with the Crypto ecosystem, but make sure they are not going to get scammed. There is righfully a lot of mistrust, fear and ill will with anything Crypto. Unfortunately, many NFT project are build on temporary hype and false promises that can leave holder (buyers) with a lot of regret. At the start of our project, we vowed to create something that was ethical, fair and transparent. Additionally, we wanted our project to be affordable and accessible to anyone that wanted a NFT. The project should be enjoyable for the most hardcore crypto people and for those who have never even heard of crypto much less interacted in the Web3 space.</p></li>

We adopted and modified color styles and iconsfrom Tailwind CSS and ditched the monospaced Space Mono typeface for the more modern and built out Montserrat typeface.</p></li>
