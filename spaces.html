                        <p>For the University of Michigan's School of Information (UMSI) Introduction to Interaction Design course's individual semester-long project, I tackled the problem of how stressful, time-consuming, and frustrating it can be for U of M students to find individual and group study spaces on campus - spaces that meet their needs for an optimal study environment, along with being close by, and that can be scheduled quickly and efficiently. Background and user research demonstrated that students are feeling the stress of this challenge even more during this COVID-19 pandemic, because they have to consider social distancing needs (which has reduced the availability of spaces), as well as often have to leave one in person class and then right after find another spot to participate in a virtual class, and vice versa. The need for a solution to this problem is further supported by research which suggests that students' productivity, anxiety and stress are greatly influenced by the study space they use, which is even more true of students with disabilities based on neurodiversity and mental health (e.g., anxiety, ADHD, autism) (Beynon-Mackinnon, et al., 2017; Weintraub, 2021).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>I designed a tool, a new standalone website, which will help college students at U of M locate and possibly reserve study spaces which are nearby and match their needs for certain features and resources, making for a more optimal study space for them. The tool - currently a high-fidelity prototype- is designed to provide equal access to information about space options to all U of M students, as it can be viewed accessibly from any device which has internet access, and used on-the-go, a crucial feature for busy college students! I served as UX Researcher and Designer, and product developer on this solo project.</p>

                            I found that there are a lot of study spaces on campus, but no central service to sort through and view all of the spaces, which makes it difficult for students to discover new spaces. Additionally, there is very little informaiton provided about study spaces, and students have specific preferences for what constitutes a "good" space for them.

                            Students want to be able to find spaces quickly and many preferred to find spaces that were close by, so that they could access them between classes and travel to them on foot. The needs students had for study spaces differed as well, depending on personal preferences and the tasks they needed to complete (e.g. background noise vs silent, group work vs individual work).

                            The tools all offered a way to locate spaces (some with very limited options), with some ability to reserve spaces, but their reservation functions were confucing to use and often produced misleading results. Some tools included very limited descriptions of amenities in the rooms (e.g., printers) and a few offered the option to filter spaces based on limited amenity offerings. None of the tools offered students the option to upload their own pictures of spaces, to review the spaces or suggest spaces. Finally, none of the competitors had all of the elements student users reported that they needed/wanted.

                        <p>If implemented, the tool will help students at U of M easily and efficiently locate and possibly reserve study spaces which are nearby and match their needs for certain features and resources, securing a more optimal study space for them.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>The tool will have a positive social impact on the U of M campus in 3 ways:</p>

                                <p>It will promote social engagement with the campus community by encouraging students to contribute to the growth of the site to help one another have a better experience finding best-for-them study spaces.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>As the tool reduces frustration and stress for already stressed students when they are looking for spaces, and helps people do their best academically by helping them identify optimal study spaces, the tool will promote mental health and academic success.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>The tool will promote equity and support students' diverse needs; the tool makes it easy for all students to access the same information, quickly and easily. In addition, I hope that having access to rich information will be of special help to students with disabilities who may need extra help identifying spaces that are a good fit for their needs.</p>
